Here's where you find out what your donations buy. Below is a detailed
breakdown of the monies the group has received and what's been done with
them. If you'd like to donate money to SLUG, we have a bank account. You
may make the check out to **SLUG** or **Suncoast Linux Users Group**. If
you can't attend meetings and but would like to donate to the group, you
may write a check (as above) and send it to:

>  SLUG\
>  c/o Bill Davison\
>  3419 West Obispo Street\
>  Tampa FL 33629\

**Note:** although no one *personally* benefits from your donations
(meaning we are non-profit), we are *not* organized as a corporation or
non-profit corporation under Florida law. Bear that in mind when making
donations.
