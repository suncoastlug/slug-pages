<a name="synopsis"></a>
## Synopsis

Hacking Sessions are an excuse to hang out a coffee shop (or bakery) with other
geeks of the programming persuasion and write code.  Originally we were going to
limit this to "new projects", but as that is unreasonable, anything goes.
However, it would be cool if you posted links (to mailing lists/facebook/
twitter/etc) of what you did during the session.


Definition: (2) hack [very common]

1.  n. Originally, a quick job that produces what is needed, but not well.
2.  n. An incredibly good, and perhaps very time-consuming, piece of work that
    produces exactly what is needed.

## Project Ideas

1.  An RSS Feed for the SLUG mailing list. Dylan wrote one a while ago, but it
    was sort of hacky.  Chotchki attempted to write one at the first hacking
    session but it was unreleased and unfinished.
2.  Upset )
    A presentation/talk submission system (that could be integrated into Upset)
3.  PHPaaSAW )
    Tool boxes at your ready, fingers nimble, lets hack!  Design and development
    phases of the new PHPaaSA Website.  Learning about Laravel and locating
    packages to wire together.  Writing simple expressions to add pages into the
    route-able structure.  Using the blade template system to display the output
    and styling from controllers.  Interacting with Eloquent database component
    to structure the relevant date and provide it upon request by the
    controllers.  Nimble fingers untie - dyslexia aside - relax, learn, and have
    fun.
4.  Scribblers )
    Reusable code that acts as a signature line (usable with stylus) that can be
    integrated with OpenEMR forms or other web forms and can save the signature
    image to the db with the form (or to a doc directory if BLOB is a really bad
    idea).
5.  File Masters )
    An OpenEMR component for helping relieve a major admin issue for thousands
    of independent rural clinics and hospitals.  Involves modifying some file
    output, generating code to sort and collate multiple query results by
    patient, and output the data generated to a text and pdf format.


<a name="teams"></a>
## Teams

For the sake of this event, we refer to "teams", which might only have one
member, but may also have other members. Each team must have a unique, humorous
name.

Teams should be decided by language/toolset, and should choose **one** and only
**one** project, which may or may not be in the above list.  Teams should make
some reasonable effort not to duplicate the same work as another team. Multiple
"solutions" to the same problem are accept (and perhaps expected) so long as a
different language/toolset is used.
