# Meetings


The **Suncoast Linux Users Group (SLUG)** holds monthly meetings at
several locations and times. The monthly meetings are a place where you
can come to get help installing Linux or debugging problems with your
installation. You can occasionally hear speakers on various subjects of
interest to the Linux community. And you can enjoy the company of others
who are interested in the same thing you are-- Linux. The cost? It's
free!

## What to bring

If you're coming to install Linux on your computer, there are a few
things you should bring with you:

- Your computer. The whole thing. If you want to test your printer,
  bring that too. If you have Apple hardware, you will have to bring
  your own copy of Linux to install, and you may have to refer
  hardware questions to your dealer, as we don't have a lot of Apple
  expertise.
- Your copy of Linux, including any manuals that came with your
  distribution. If you want to install someone else's copy of Linux,
  make sure they're going to bring it to the meeting.
- Any manuals for your computer, including manuals for any of the
  add-on cards, etc., that you have.
- Any DOS software you might need to configure network cards and the
  like.
- Any floppies you might need to create boot disks with.
- Pen and paper to record any sage advice you are given, as well as
  settings for your computer.
- Patience and a sense of humor!

## What to do before you come

Along with the items you should bring for installing Linux, there are
some details you should take care of before you come:

- Back up everything of value on your computer. Things can sometimes
  go wrong, and if you can't afford to lose what's on your hard drive,
  back it up first.
- Write down every setting, IRQ, memory address, add-on card
  manufacturer, make and model of everything about your computer.
  Trying to figure this out at the meeting wastes valuable time.
- Run scandisk/chkdsk and defragment your hard drive if you are coming
  from a DOS/Windows environment.
- Ensure you have enough memory and hard disk space to complete your
  Linux installation. At a minimum, this means 256megs of memory and 3
  gigs of hard drive space.

## Warning!

While we will help you all we can, we cannot guarantee that the
installation will be compatible with your particular hardware, nor that
we will be able to successfully configure it to run. We are not
responsible for any damage or loss during or as a consequence of
installing and configuring Linux, X, or anything else.
