# SLUG Mailing Lists


The SLUG mailing lists have been created as a service to, and in support
of, members of the Suncoast Linux Users Group.  **Note: no one is
automatically subscribed to these lists, unless you specifically request
this on your New Member Survey!**

The following lists are available to the SLUG membership at large:

- [SLUG Announce][slug-announce] - For group announcements.
- [SLUG List][slug-list] - For normal technical assistance and Linux/computer-related topics.
- [SLUG Politics][slug-politics] - For topics too hot for the SLUG list.

You can review the **[rules][list-rules]** for the lists.

[Instructions][list-instructions] for posting, subscribing and
unsubscribing.

[Find out][list-subscribe-unsubscribe] if you're already subscribed or
unsubscribed.

To search the message archives for the SLUG and other lists:

- [SLUG Announce][slug-announce-list-mail]
- [SLUG List][slug-list-mail]
- [SLUG Politics][slug-politics-list-mail]

(Sorry, this only goes from 10 April 2001 to the present.)

## The SLUG Announce List

This list is for meeting and group event announcements only. **You may
not post to this list.** When you sign up as a member of SLUG, you are
given the option to subscribe to this list. **This may be the only way
you hear about meetings.**

To **subscribe** or **unsubscribe**, follow the
[instructions][list-instructions].


<a name="slug-main-list"></a>
## The SLUG Mailing List

This is the main list for SLUG members. The primary purpose of this list
is primarily to provide mutual assistance to SLUG members with technical
questions. See the [rules][list-rules] for more information about what is and
isn't allowed.

To **subscribe**, **unsubscribe** or **post**, see the
[instructions][list-instructions].


<a name="slug-politics-list"></a>
## The SLUG Politics List

This list is for topics too volatile or off topic for the main SLUG
list. There are no rules on this list, and no topic is forbidden. Even
netiquette rules don't apply. If you post something too hot for the main
SLUG list, you may be asked to move the discussion to this list.

To **subscribe**, **unsubscribe** or **post**, see the
[instructions][list-instructions].
