## Computer &amp; Technology Showcase, May 2001

After the rousing success of our first [CTS Expo][history-2000-09], Event
Management invited us back for one on 30 and 31 May 2001, at the Harborview
Center in Clearwater. This time, they gave us a 20' by 40' booth and a "Linux
Pavillion".

As before, Bill Preece and Diana Lenko did the lion's share of the work, aided
and abetted by [NKS][nks]. They managed to get Jon "maddog" Hall of
[Linux International][li] to attend and give the keynote speech. Ralph Cooley,
of IBM, and a couple of other speakers also attended, as well as Robin Miller of
NewsForge. Unfortunately, the Harborview had made no arrangement for high speed
internet access, so we had to make do with 33.6K through Harborview's PBX. But
NKS hooked it all up to their very impressive rack system, and provided internet
access to any machine that needed it.

This event coincided with the release of Microsoft Office XP, which took place
upstairs from the show floor. Microsoft had a large blow-up replica of an Office
XP box at the entrance to the Harborview on the second day. So of course, some
penguinistas decided that Linux deserved equal time. They stood outside the 
entrance and handed out Linux Journals until someone from Microsoft got upset
and called the show's organizer. The penguinistas made a deal where they would
move inside, which they did. Now they stood at the escalators and handed out
Linux Journals. Even though the Microsoft people had agreed, apparently this was
not enough. So they contacted the Harborview Center directly. Now the
penguinistas were forced to return to the show floor. But they'd made their
point. And somewhere in all this, Maddog got into it with the Microsoft people
as well. &lt;Grin&gt;

Many many SLUGs came out and assisted, and we handed out approximately 5000
distros, along with a lot of other free stuff. And as always, SLUG was the hit
of the event. We had the most lively people, having the most fun, with the most
activity around our booth. See [here][nks-cts] for pictures.
