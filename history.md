## August 1997

In August 1997, Henry White, Paul Foster, Ed Centanni and a few others
were looking for a local Linux group in the Tampa Bay area. Paul put his
name up on the GLUE (Groups of Linux Users Everywhere) site,
volunteering to start a group if none could be found. Henry sent emails
to Paul and just about everyone else he could find about the possibility
of starting/finding a group. Thirty-five emails were sent out. Eleven
were undeliverable, and seven did not reply. The rest were interested!

Henry volunteered to lead the group. Paul suggested the SLUG name, had
his wife come up with a logo, and provided server space for a SLUG
website. Henry soon "liberated" a lot of web content from the North
Texas Linux Users Group (NTLUG), and this was integrated into the
website.

By the end of August 1997, SLUG had twenty members and a full-featured
website.

## October 1997

In October of 1997, based on Ed Centanni's suggestion, Paul Foster
organized the first SLUG meeting at Chili's in Clearwater. It was a
rainy day in late October, the day of the first ever USF homecoming
game. Thirteen people showed up. It was noisy and informal, but it was a
start.

Soon thereafter, Martin Randal joined the group and offered his services
as listmaster; now SLUG had a mailing list!


<a name="1997-12"></a>
## December 1997

Martin Randal organized a stable meeting place and site for installfests
at Thomas Jefferson High School in Tampa on the second Wednesday of each
month. We held our first installfest at TJHS on 10 December 1997.

By the end of the 1997, SLUG had 66 members!

## May 1998

In May of 1998, Bob Kindle negotiated with the Dunedin Public Library to
allow us to hold Saturday meetings there. The first was held on the 23rd
of May 1998 (Memorial Day weekend). Four SLUGs attended due to the
holiday and under-promotion. But since then the number at the Dunedin
meetings has been similar to that in Tampa.


<a name="1998-12"></a>
## December 1998

Henry White, long wishing to pass on the leadership of SLUG to someone
else, presided over elections for new officers. Paul M. Foster was
elected President, and Paul Braman (our longtime meeting organizer) was
elected Vice President for Meetings. The "election" was the quickest in
history. "Foster wants to do this and Braman wants to do that. Any
objections? Done!"


<a name="1999-01"></a>
## January 1999

SLUG became a GLUE (Groups of Linux Users Everywhere) member, and
received a "care package" of goodies from SSC (publishers of Linux
Journal and sponsors of GLUE). We also had our first outside presenter,
and created the SLUG Lending Library for users to borrow distributions
and software between meetings.


<a name="1999-02"></a>
## February 1999

SLUG welcomes its 200th member!


<a name="1999-05"></a>
## May 1999

An online dispute between some members and the list sponsor/admin causes
the list to go dark one Sunday afternoon. After three days of frantic
effort, Russ Herrold of the Central Ohio Linux Users Group (COLUG)
volunteers to host the SLUG list. The SLUG Announce list is also
inaugurated.

Thanks to the sponsorship of the Tampa Bay Computer Society, SLUG is
invited to participate in the ITEC show at the Tampa Convention Center.
But we're invited too late, and end up with a auditorium under the
stairwell, not a booth on the show floor. Traffic is dismal, and overall
the effort is wasted.


<a name="1999-07-24"></a>
## 24 July 1999

Our first big-name presenter appears! [Stuart Anderson][stuart-anderson]
of Metro Link gave a talk about the
[Linux Standard Base project][linux-standard-base].


<a name="1999-08"></a>
## August 1999

SLUG acquires its own domain name: [SuncoastLUG.org][suncoastlug]! Thanks
to Mark Bishop (a SLUG member in absentia) for doing the registration,
and Terry Mackintosh for hosting the domain.

Paul Foster and Ed Centanni presented a demonstration of Linux for the
Greater Tampa Bay PC Users Group. The presentation was well received,
and they were invited back.

SLUG welcomes its three hundredth member!


<a name="2000-01"></a>
## January 2000

SLUG survives the Y2K bug (along with everyone else) and acquires a
separate List Admin, a new Event Coordinator, and an Expansion Director
(Marketing/PR person). Q & A sessions at every meeting are instituted,
and presentations are scheduled for most meetings. Paul Braman opts out
as Event/Meeting Coordinator.


<a name="2000-03"></a>
## March 2000

SLUG moves its website and domain name to one of Owl River Company's
hosts. These are the same people who have hosted the lists for almost a
year.


<a name="2000-08"></a>
## August 2000

After one too many flamefests, the SLUG Politics list is inaugurated.
The purpose of the list is to defuse sensitive threads and provide an
outlet for the more politically active SLUG members.


<a name="2000-09"></a>
## September 2000

SLUG is asked to man a booth at the Computer and Technology Showcase at
the Tampa Convention Center on the 27th and 28th. Thanks to the efforts
of Bill Preece, Diana Lenko, Norb Cartagena, Tim Jones, Curt Johnson, Ed
Centanni and others, the show is a TREMENDOUS success! Thousands of
Linux distros are acquired and passed out. Speakers from Red Hat, Turbo
Linux, Andover and others make presentations. This is a sharp contrast
to the ITEC show in May of 1999.

SLUG has over 400 members.


<a name="2001-03"></a>
## March 2001

Bylaws are amended and "splinter groups" are eliminated. Instead,
leaders of meetings other than Tampa and Dunedin meetings become
officers of the group. They get a full vote on group matters, and their
meetings are announced in the same way Tampa and Dunedin meetings are
announced.

Q & A sessions at Tampa and Dunedin meetings are discontinued, as they
quickly go out of control and degrade into group discussions.


<a name="2001-04"></a>
## April 2001

A four day list outage occurs on the Owl River Company list host. After
a local company-- Networked Knowledge Systems (NKS)-- offers to host the
lists, they are moved to NKS hosts. The SLUG website continues to reside
on an Owl River Company host.


<a name="2001-05"></a>
## May 2001

SLUG participates in its second [CTS Expo][cts-expo], with a 20'x40' booth and
"Linux Pavilion", this time at the Harborview in Clearwater. This
coincided with the launch of Microsoft's Office XP, and as before, we
were the busiest booth at the show. John "Maddog" Hall was a featured
speaker, and we had a couple of run-ins with Microsoft people.

For a more complete rundown, check out the [CTS Expo][cts-expo].

Sarasota meetings are started.


<a name="2001-08-10"></a>
## 10 August 2001

Linux Tenth Anniversary Picnic takes place at Lowry Park in Tampa.


<a name="2001-10-17-18"></a>
## 17 - 18 October 2001

Our third CTS Expo, held at the Tampa Convention Center. This was barely
a month after the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, so attendance
was off and several exhibitors had backed out of the show. We hosted the
Melbourne LUG and IDEAL Corporation in our booth.


<a name="2002-11"></a>
## November 2002

A SLUG member (Aaron Steimle) finally starts up a St Petersburg meeting.


<a name="2003-01-05"></a>
## 5 January 2003

Two members of SLUG, not content with the policies of SLUG and their
treatment by SLUG members, start their own LUG as an *alternative* to
SLUG: [FLALUG][].


<a name="2003-11"></a>
## November 2003

Due to lingering site outages, the SLUG website is moved to an alternate
local hosting service, Networked Knowledge Systems (NKS).


<a name="2003-12-17-18"></a>
## 17 - 18 December 2003

Bill Preece and his helpers again pull off a great tech show, this time
the Biz2Expo at the Tampa Convention Center.

Mario Lombardo volunteers to lead the Tampa meetings, currently held at
Hillsborough Community College, taking over for Paul Foster.

## 10 September 2005

*Software Freedom Day* was celebrated at both MOSI (Museum of Science
and Industry) in Tampa, and Books A Million in Bradenton. SLUG members
organized these events on their own and gave out quite a few Linux CDs.


<a name="2006-09-16"></a>
## 16 September 2006

Jonathon Conte again spearheaded *Software Freedom Day* events at MOSI
and Mirta's Coffee House in Tampa. Over 700 CDs were given away at these
highly successful events.


<a name="2007-06-07"></a>
## 7 June 2007

Citing falling attendance and lack of meaningful participation, Bill
Preece conducted the last Brandon meeting on this date. Bill is thanked
for 8+ years of faithfully running this meeting.


<a name="2007-06-26"></a>
## 26 June 2007

Due to lack of attendance and inability to find a willing meeting
coordinator, Sarasota meetings are dropped.


<a name="2007-10-06"></a>
## 6 October 2007
